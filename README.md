# machine-learning-scholar-adventure
A curated path of high quality resources to learn machine learning

## Path
This curriculum will help tak you from machine learning newbie to machine learning scholar and finally to machine learning
practitioner. It’s a work in progress and the syllabus will be updated to reflect progress on the path I'm taking. 
The title of each resource links to the place where you can find it if you’d like to explore it as part of your machine learning journey.
